This project is a webpage that allows the user to play Rock Paper Scissors, built from JavaScript and basic HTML.

The project primarily demonstrates basic programming logic, JavaScript fundamentals (e.g., variables, data types, built-in methods, functions, object literals, loops, ternaries, conditionals), and DOM manipulation (e.g., selecting, modifying, creating, and appending DOM nodes).
